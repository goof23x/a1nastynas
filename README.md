A1Nas is a simple, secure, and powerful NAS operating system built on Ubuntu Server LTS. It provides a modern, Google Drive-inspired web interface for managing your storage, with built-in support for ZFS, Docker, and the LSI 9300-16i SAS controller. The UI features custom branding and a default background image (`a1nas.png`).

## Pre-Installation Checklist

### Required Hardware
- Server or PC with 64-bit x86 processor
- Minimum 4GB RAM (8GB recommended)
- 2 or more hard drives for RAID
- USB flash drive (8GB or larger)
- Network connection (Ethernet recommended)
- LSI 9300-16i SAS controller (optional)

### Required Software
1. **For Windows Users**:
   - Download [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/)
   - Download A1Nas v0.1.0 ISO from [releases](https://github.com/goob/a1nas/releases)

2. **For Mac Users**:
   - Download [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)
   - Download A1Nas v0.1.0 ISO from [releases](https://github.com/goob/a1nas/releases)

3. **For Linux Users**:
   - Install Etcher: `sudo snap install etcher`
   - Download A1Nas v0.1.0 ISO from [releases](https://github.com/goob/a1nas/releases)

### Network Preparation
1. Ensure your network has:
   - DHCP server (most home routers have this)
   - Port 443 (HTTPS) accessible
   - Port 22 (SSH) accessible if you need remote access

### Domain Setup (Optional)
If you want to use a custom domain:
1. Register a domain name (e.g., from Namecheap, GoDaddy)
2. Set up DNS A record pointing to your server's IP
3. Ensure port 80 and 443 are forwarded to your server

## For Developers: Building and Publishing the ISO

1. Build the ISO:
   ```bash
   sudo bash build/build_live_iso_enhanced.sh
   cd live-build-a1nas
   sudo lb build
   ```
   The ISO will be created as `live-image-amd64.hybrid.iso`.

2. Test the ISO in a VM or on real hardware:
   ```bash
   # Run verification script
   sudo /usr/local/bin/a1nas-verify.sh
   
   # Check critical services
   systemctl status docker nginx ssh
   
   # Verify packages
   dpkg -l | grep -E 'docker|nginx|samba|zfs'
   ```

3. Go to your GitHub repository ‚Üí Releases ‚Üí Draft a new release.
4. Upload the ISO as a release asset and publish the release.
5. Share the direct download link with users for seamless installation.

## Testing in a Virtual Machine

### Recommended VM Setup
1. **VirtualBox Setup**:
   - Download [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
   - Create new VM with these settings:
     - Type: Linux
     - Version: Ubuntu (64-bit)
     - RAM: 4GB minimum
     - CPU: 2 cores minimum
     - Storage: 20GB for system + 2x 10GB virtual drives for testing RAID
     - Network: Bridged Adapter
   - Enable virtualization in BIOS if not already enabled

2. **VMware Setup**:
   - Download [VMware Workstation Player](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html)
   - Create new VM with similar settings as VirtualBox
   - Enable "Virtualize Intel VT-x/EPT or AMD-V/RVI" in VM settings

### Testing Steps
1. Boot the VM from the A1Nas ISO
2. Follow the first-boot wizard
3. Test basic functionality:
   - Web interface access
   - ZFS pool creation
   - Docker container deployment
   - File operations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Boot Issues
1. **System won't boot from USB**
   - Check if USB is properly formatted
   - Try different USB ports
   - Verify BIOS/UEFI boot order
   - Solution: Recreate bootable USB with Rufus/Etcher

2. **Black screen after boot**
   - Check if virtualization is enabled in BIOS
   - Try booting with `nomodeset` kernel parameter
   - Solution: Add `nomodeset` to kernel boot parameters

#### Network Issues
1. **Can't access web interface**
   - Check if server has IP address: `ip addr show`
   - Verify network connectivity: `ping 8.8.8.8`
   - Check if services are running: `systemctl status nginx` and (if set up) `systemctl status a1nas`
   - Solution: Restart network service: `systemctl restart networking`

2. **SSL certificate errors**
   - Check if port 80/443 is accessible
   - Verify DNS settings
   - Solution: Run `certbot --nginx -d your-domain.com`

#### Storage Issues
1. **Drives not detected**
   - Check drive connections
   - Verify BIOS settings
   - Run: `lsblk` to list drives
   - Solution: Check drive connections and BIOS settings

2. **ZFS pool creation fails**
   - Check drive status: `zpool status`
   - Verify drive permissions
   - Solution: Run `zpool create -f poolname mirror /dev/sdX /dev/sdY`

#### Performance Issues
1. **Slow file transfers**
   - Check network speed: `iperf3 -c server`
   - Monitor system resources: `htop`
   - Solution: Optimize network settings or upgrade hardware

2. **High CPU usage**
   - Check running processes: `top`
   - Monitor Docker containers: `docker stats`
   - Solution: Identify and stop resource-intensive processes

### Diagnostic Commands
```bash
# System status
systemctl status nginx
systemctl status a1nas  # If backend service is set up
systemctl status docker

# Storage status
zpool status
zfs list
lsblk

# Network status
